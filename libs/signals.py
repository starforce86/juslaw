class M2MChangedSignalHandler(object):
    """Used as M2M signal handlers.

    All M2M signals in Django are handled by one handler, which gets ``action``
    attribute. ``action`` contains signal type (post_add, post_remove,
    post_clear, etc.) More about m2m signals you can find in Django docs.

    This class has one method - ``handle`` which has the same signature as
    m2m-signal's handler.

    To add processing of specific m2m signal you need to implement
    appropriate method for specific action.

    Examples:
        # implement handler
        class MyM2MHandler(M2MChangedSignalHandler):
            def post_add(self):
                # do something

            def post_remove(self):
                # do something

        # register handler
        # as soon as signal must be function (not class method) we have to
        # register this handler in this way

        @receiver(m2m_changed, sender=AppUser.groups.through)
        def signal_m2m_changed_auth_group(**kwargs):
            MyM2MHandler(**kwargs).handle()
