// This is needed.
// From Firebase docs:
// The messaging service requires a firebase-messaging-sw.js file. Unless you already have a firebase-messaging-sw.js
// file, create an empty file with that name and place it in the root of your domain before retrieving a token. You can
// add meaningful content to the file later in the client setup process.
