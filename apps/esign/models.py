        signing.

        - sent - email notification with a link to envelope has been sent to

        - delivered - all recipients have viewed the document(s) in an envelope
        through the DocuSign signing web site.

        - signed - the envelope has been signed by all the recipients. This is
        a temporary state during processing, after which the envelope is
        automatically moved to Completed status.
