            deletion in DocuSign

    Currently there is a problem in DocuSign that it removes all envelopes for
    `demo` accounts after 30 days and only `draft` envelopes in production
    after 30 days too without any notifications and webhooks.

    https://support.docusign.com/articles/How-long-does-DocuSign-store-my-documents

    Here app handles old envelopes and tries to remove it if possible, there
    are performed following steps:

    1. Try to get `edit` link for envelope:

        - If link could be get - it means that envelope wasn't removed from
        DocuSign yet and we shouldn't clean it up.

        -  If `NoEnvelopeExists` exception is raised - it means that envelope
        was already deleted from DocuSign and we need to clean up it from our
        DB.

        -  If any other exception is raised - it means that we can't get
        `edit` link for this envelope because of absent matter's attorney
        `consent`. So we shouldn't make any envelope deletion here.

    2. Delete envelope and move corresponding matter to `draft` state if its
    `initial` envelope was removed.
